          Honey was developed with the care and attention of a team who has
          worked alongside MSPs of every size to help them achieve their sales
          and marketing dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          And along the way, we kept seeing the same struggles. Visibility,
          accountability, manual data management â€” no matter the company, they
          had to put in the work to clear the same bottlenecks.
        </p>
        <p>Not anymore. Today, there's Honey.</p>
